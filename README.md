# Hash Viewer
Check file hashes, the safer way. Especially because it's open source.

## Installation
You will need python for this. To install python, go to https://www.python.org/downloads and download it.

So, when you get python, run the application TheApp.py

That's it for installation!

## Using the Tool
When you launch it, you will see a prompt if you want to change the directory or not.
WARNING: Do not input the directory of the folder of the file, or else the application will crash. I might fix that later, this is the 1.0 (stable release) version anyways.

So. If the file is not located in the same folder as the python file, then you can just input it's directory in there.

Example: C:\Users\mike\Desktop\Folder

Then, you'll have to input the filename of the file, so it can scan it for the hash of it.

Example: docs.txt

Then, you'll see 2 weird spam stuff. They are the hashes of the file! The order of them is: SHA1, SHA256.
